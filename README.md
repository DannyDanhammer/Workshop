# WorkshopCTF Instruction:

Scenario Brief
You are part of a red team assigned to assess a hospital network currently under adversarial control. Intelligence indicates that a satellite medical office maintains trusted connectivity with the primary hospital infrastructure. This satellite location represents a potential pivot point into the core environment.
Initial access has been established on workstations within the satellite office. During post-exploitation reconnaissance, the team identified insecure DICOM workflows that may provide a pathway into the hospital’s imaging infrastructure.
Mission Objective
Your task is to analyze the DICOM workflow, identify weaknesses, and leverage them to gain control of a DICOM server within the hospital network. Successful exploitation will provide access to sensitive operational data stored on that system.
The objective marker (flag) resides on the compromised DICOM server.
